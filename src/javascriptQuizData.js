      description: `JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables dynamic behavior on websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which structure and style content, JavaScript adds interactivity, such as form validation, animations, pop-ups, sliders, and dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
  
  Key Features of JavaScript:
  Client-Side Language: Runs in the browser, allowing immediate interaction without needing a server.
  
  Syntax: Similar to other programming languages like C or Java. It includes variables (let, const, var), functions, loops, and conditionals.
  
  DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can access and modify HTML elements and CSS styles through the Document Object Model (DOM).
  
  Events: JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, form submissions, key presses, and more using event listeners.
  
  Popular Uses: Form validation, interactive maps, games, animations, real-time updates, and building single-page applications (SPAs) with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.`,

      Key concepts include variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and event handling. 
      
      It is an essential tool in web development, especially when combined with HTML and CSS to build fully interactive web applications.`
