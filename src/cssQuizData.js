      description: `CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of an HTML document.
  
  While HTML structures the content of a webpage, CSS controls its presentation, such as layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and animations.
  
  Key Concepts in CSS:
  Selectors: These target HTML elements to apply styles. Examples: p, .className, #idName.
  
  Properties and Values: CSS applies styles using properties (like color, font-size, margin) with assigned values (like blue, 16px, 10px).
  
  Types of CSS:
  
  Inline CSS: Written directly in the HTML element using the style attribute.
  
  Internal CSS: Written inside a <style> tag within the HTML <head>.
  
  External CSS: Stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using <link>.
  
  Box Model: Every HTML element is treated as a box with four layersâ€”content, padding, border, and margin.
  
  Cascading Rule: If multiple styles apply to the same element, CSS follows a hierarchy (inline > internal > external) to determine which style is applied.`,
      note: `CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the visual appearance of HTML content on a webpage. 
      
      It allows developers to style elements by defining properties like color, font, layout, and spacing.
      
      CSS can be applied in three ways: inline (within the HTML element), internal (within a <style> tag), and external (linked through a .css file).
      
      It works through selectors and follows a box model concept, which includes content, padding, border, and margin. 
      
      CSS follows a priority system where inline styles override internal and external styles. Overall, CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and responsive web designs.`
